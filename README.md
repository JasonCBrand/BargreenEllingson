  Updated the InventoryController to run asynchronously following the async/await pattern
  Modified the Bargreen.API project and InventoryController to use dependency injection
  Implemented the method ReconcileInventoryToAccounting in the InventoryService class. The method returns a list that indicates where inventory balances match or     mismatch the accounting balances with the actual values of each
 Wrote unit tests to verify the output of the algorithm you wrote in the step before.
 
Wrote a SQL query to compare inventory balances to accounting records and show differences
